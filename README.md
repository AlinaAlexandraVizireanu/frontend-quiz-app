## My process

I started this project by checking the design on the Figma file, then I created the website's structure with HTML and then used CSS to implement the style. To create the layout I used Flexbox mainly. The logic part of the application was built with JavaScript where I had to make the web page as dynamic as required so that there was no need to implement additional HTML web pages. For the required data I used the provided data.json file and axios to get the data on the web page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Axios

### What I learned

The process of building this web page was a bit challenging, but it helped me to consolidate my JavaScript knowledges.
